# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML
This repository details a comprehensive machine learning workflow for a classification project, likely related to risk factor analysis, such as diabetes prediction. The process outlines steps from initial data ingestion to final result generation and is designed as a clean template for beginners to understand the core ML lifecycle.  
Usage : 
Data Processing: How to execute the "Data Cleaning" and "Outliers Identification and Handling" steps.
Feature Engineering: How to run the "Feature Extraction" process.
Model Training: Commands or scripts to train the various "Classifier Types" and the "Ensemble with Voting method".
Analysis: Instructions for generating the "Analysis of Risk Factors" and "Results".

Methodology :
A high-level description of the workflow shown in the flowchart, mentioning the specific techniques like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Cross Validation used.
